# Changelog

One entry per milestone: what was ported or built, how it was verified, and
what is still open (`README.md`'s working discipline).

## Phase 0 — Walking skeleton (2026-08-11)

No engine logic. Proves the toolchain end to end before porting any formula
(`ROADMAP.md`, `TOOLCHAIN.md`).

**Built:**

- Cargo workspace at `cartalith-native/` with the nine crates
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` specifies (`cartalith-noise/-rng/-terrain/-climate/
  -erosion/-hydrology/-engine/-io/-godot`). Eight are empty stubs — one
  trivial test each, no logic — matching Phase 0's "no engine logic yet."
  `cartalith-godot` is the only one that does anything: it depends on
  `gdext` (crate `godot` 0.5.5, `api-4-7` feature) and exposes a
  `WalkingSkeleton : Node` with a `ping() -> String` method.
- `godot-project/` — a minimal Godot 4.7.1 project (`project.godot`,
  `main.tscn`, `main.gd`, `cartalith.gdextension`) with a triangle, a
  button, a label, and the `WalkingSkeleton` node, per the "triangle,
  button, printed line" bar in `ROADMAP.md`.

**Verified — actually ran, not just compiled:**

- `cargo build -p cartalith-godot` (native Linux, debug): compiles.
- `godot4 --headless --import .`: **loads** the extension —
  `Initialize godot-rust (API v4.7.stable.official, runtime
  v4.7.1.stable.official, safeguards strict)` in the log.
- `godot4 --headless --quit main.tscn`: runs the scene one frame and exits
  0, with `WalkingSkeleton::ready()`'s `godot_print!` line in the output.
  This is the headless engine runtime, not the graphical editor — no
  display is available in this session, so the editor UI, the button
  click, and the on-screen triangle are unverified (`DECISIONS.md` §5).
- Windows: `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` build (mingw-w64, `TOOLCHAIN.md`'s
  documented fallback — `cargo-xwin`'s MSVC route is covered below) →
  `godot4 --headless --export-debug "Windows Desktop" ...` and
  `--export-release` both produced a real PE32+ `Cartalith.exe` with the
  extension `.dll` alongside it. Compiles and packages only; nobody has
  run it on Windows (`DECISIONS.md` §5, `MVP_SCOPE.md` criterion 3).
- Android: **not verified.** `cargo ndk build` fails at the first step —
  no NDK is installed, and none of this session's available channels can
  install one (below). Everything short of that step is in place: Rust
  Android targets installed, the `android.*` lines in
  `cartalith.gdextension`, and an `Android` preset in
  `export_presets.cfg`.

**Toolchain installed this session:**

- Rust targets: `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`,
  `aarch64-linux-android`, `armv7-linux-androideabi`,
  `x86_64-linux-android`, `i686-linux-android`.
- `cargo-xwin` 0.23, `cargo-ndk` 4.1.2 (installed; `cargo-xwin` cannot
  complete a build here — see below).
- Godot 4.7.1-stable (latest stable 4.x as of this session, superseding
  the "verify before pinning" placeholder in `DECISIONS.md` §9) — editor
  binary and both export-template sets, from GitHub Releases.
- `gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64` / `g++-mingw-w64-x86-64` via apt, for the
  Windows-GNU fallback.

## Open / blocked

**Android SDK and NDK could not be installed in this session — two
independent official channels are both blocked by this session's network
policy, confirmed rather than assumed:**

1. `dl.google.com` (the sole official host for the SDK command-line tools
   and the NDK) — direct `curl` and the Ubuntu `google-android-*-installer`
   packages both fail identically: `Proxy tunneling failed: Forbidden`.
2. The `barichello/godot-ci` Docker image (which bundles an
   officially-sourced SDK+NDK) — the registry API itself
   (`registry-1.docker.io`) is reachable, but blob downloads redirect to a
   CDN host that the proxy also rejects with 403.

Separately: Godot 4.7.1 pins **NDK 29.0.14206865**
(`platform/android/detect.py`), well past the newest version
(`google-android-ndk-r26c-installer`) Ubuntu's apt packaging offers — so
even a working apt mirror would not have supplied the right version.
`export-pipeline.md`'s "23.2.8568313 at the time of writing" is stale;
noted there.

**This is the named Phase 0 risk landing, just not the anticipated shape.**
`TOOLCHAIN.md` and `REFERENCES.md` flagged gdext's Android support itself
as the risk (experimental, "documentation and tooling still lacking"). What
actually blocked Phase 0 here is this session's network egress policy, not
gdext — the Rust/Godot/Android integration itself is untested in either
direction. Whoever runs Phase 0 next with SDK/NDK access should expect the
*next* failure, if any, to be the one the docs anticipated.

**To finish Android Phase 0** (from a session or machine with SDK/NDK
access): install the SDK platform tools + NDK 29.0.14206865, set
`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`, then:

```bash
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a build -p cartalith-godot
godot4 --headless --export-debug "Android" builds/android/Cartalith.apk
```

`export_presets.cfg`'s Android preset currently builds `arm64` only
(matches real devices, per `TOOLCHAIN.md`); flip the other `arch/*` keys
on once armv7/x86 emulator coverage is wanted.

**`cargo-xwin`'s MSVC route is also blocked**, same category: its
first-run CRT/SDK fetch hits `aka.ms`, which this session's proxy also
rejects. Windows Phase 0 succeeded anyway via the documented mingw-w64
fallback (`TOOLCHAIN.md`), so this did not block the milestone — noted so
the next session doesn't re-diagnose it. `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` produces a
working extension DLL; whether MSVC is worth pursuing later (matching
users' ABI expectations exactly, per `DECISIONS.md`) is open.

**Not started:** everything past the walking skeleton — no engine crate has
logic yet (Phase 1, `MVP_SCOPE.md`).
