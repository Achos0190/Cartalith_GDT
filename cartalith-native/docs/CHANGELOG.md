# Changelog

One entry per milestone: what was ported or built, how it was verified, and
what is still open (`README.md`'s working discipline).

## Phase 0 — Walking skeleton (2026-08-11)

No engine logic. Proves the toolchain end to end before porting any formula
(`ROADMAP.md`, `TOOLCHAIN.md`).

**Built:**

- Cargo workspace at `cartalith-native/` with the nine crates
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` specifies (`cartalith-noise/-rng/-terrain/-climate/
  -erosion/-hydrology/-engine/-io/-godot`). Eight are empty stubs — one
  trivial test each, no logic — matching Phase 0's "no engine logic yet."
  `cartalith-godot` is the only one that does anything: it depends on
  `gdext` (crate `godot` 0.5.5, `api-4-7` feature) and exposes a
  `WalkingSkeleton : Node` with a `ping() -> String` method.
- `godot-project/` — a minimal Godot 4.7.1 project (`project.godot`,
  `main.tscn`, `main.gd`, `cartalith.gdextension`) with a triangle, a
  button, a label, and the `WalkingSkeleton` node, per the "triangle,
  button, printed line" bar in `ROADMAP.md`.

**Verified — actually ran, not just compiled:**

- `cargo build -p cartalith-godot` (native Linux, debug): compiles.
- `godot4 --headless --import .`: **loads** the extension —
  `Initialize godot-rust (API v4.7.stable.official, runtime
  v4.7.1.stable.official, safeguards strict)` in the log.
- `godot4 --headless --quit main.tscn`: runs the scene one frame and exits
  0, with `WalkingSkeleton::ready()`'s `godot_print!` line in the output.
  This is the headless engine runtime, not the graphical editor — no
  display is available in this session, so the editor UI, the button
  click, and the on-screen triangle are unverified (`DECISIONS.md` §5).
- Windows: `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` build (mingw-w64, `TOOLCHAIN.md`'s
  documented fallback — `cargo-xwin`'s MSVC route is covered below) →
  `godot4 --headless --export-debug "Windows Desktop" ...` and
  `--export-release` both produced a real PE32+ `Cartalith.exe` with the
  extension `.dll` alongside it. Compiles and packages only; nobody has
  run it on Windows (`DECISIONS.md` §5, `MVP_SCOPE.md` criterion 3).
- Android: **not verified.** `cargo ndk build` fails at the first step —
  no NDK is installed, and none of this session's available channels can
  install one (below). Everything short of that step is in place: Rust
  Android targets installed, the `android.*` lines in
  `cartalith.gdextension`, and an `Android` preset in
  `export_presets.cfg`.

**Toolchain installed this session:**

- Rust targets: `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`,
  `aarch64-linux-android`, `armv7-linux-androideabi`,
  `x86_64-linux-android`, `i686-linux-android`.
- `cargo-xwin` 0.23, `cargo-ndk` 4.1.2 (installed; `cargo-xwin` cannot
  complete a build here — see below).
- Godot 4.7.1-stable (latest stable 4.x as of this session, superseding
  the "verify before pinning" placeholder in `DECISIONS.md` §9) — editor
  binary and both export-template sets, from GitHub Releases.
- `gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64` / `g++-mingw-w64-x86-64` via apt, for the
  Windows-GNU fallback.

## Open / blocked

**Android SDK and NDK could not be installed in this session — two
independent official channels are both blocked by this session's network
policy, confirmed rather than assumed:**

1. `dl.google.com` (the sole official host for the SDK command-line tools
   and the NDK) — direct `curl` and the Ubuntu `google-android-*-installer`
   packages both fail identically: `Proxy tunneling failed: Forbidden`.
2. The `barichello/godot-ci` Docker image (which bundles an
   officially-sourced SDK+NDK) — the registry API itself
   (`registry-1.docker.io`) is reachable, but blob downloads redirect to a
   CDN host that the proxy also rejects with 403.

Separately: Godot 4.7.1 pins **NDK 29.0.14206865**
(`platform/android/detect.py`), well past the newest version
(`google-android-ndk-r26c-installer`) Ubuntu's apt packaging offers — so
even a working apt mirror would not have supplied the right version.
`export-pipeline.md`'s "23.2.8568313 at the time of writing" is stale;
noted there.

**This is the named Phase 0 risk landing, just not the anticipated shape.**
`TOOLCHAIN.md` and `REFERENCES.md` flagged gdext's Android support itself
as the risk (experimental, "documentation and tooling still lacking"). What
actually blocked Phase 0 here is this session's network egress policy, not
gdext — the Rust/Godot/Android integration itself is untested in either
direction. Whoever runs Phase 0 next with SDK/NDK access should expect the
*next* failure, if any, to be the one the docs anticipated.

**To finish Android Phase 0** (from a session or machine with SDK/NDK
access): install the SDK platform tools + NDK 29.0.14206865, set
`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`, then:

```bash
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a build -p cartalith-godot
godot4 --headless --export-debug "Android" builds/android/Cartalith.apk
```

`export_presets.cfg`'s Android preset currently builds `arm64` only
(matches real devices, per `TOOLCHAIN.md`); flip the other `arch/*` keys
on once armv7/x86 emulator coverage is wanted.

**`cargo-xwin`'s MSVC route is also blocked**, same category: its
first-run CRT/SDK fetch hits `aka.ms`, which this session's proxy also
rejects. Windows Phase 0 succeeded anyway via the documented mingw-w64
fallback (`TOOLCHAIN.md`), so this did not block the milestone — noted so
the next session doesn't re-diagnose it. `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` produces a
working extension DLL; whether MSVC is worth pursuing later (matching
users' ABI expectations exactly, per `DECISIONS.md`) is open.

**Not started:** everything past the walking skeleton — no engine crate has
logic yet (Phase 1, `MVP_SCOPE.md`).

## Phase 0 follow-up — owner verification on real Windows (2026-08-11)

The owner opened `godot-project/` in the Godot 4.7.1 editor on their own
Windows machine: the scene rendered (triangle, label, button), which
`ROADMAP.md`'s bar asks for and this session's headless run couldn't show.

**Found a real bug in the process — `.gdextension` pointed at the wrong
Windows path.** The checked-in manifest had
`windows.debug.x86_64 = "res://../target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/debug/..."`,
because that is where *this session's* mingw-w64 cross-build (the
`cargo-xwin`/MSVC fallback, see above) happened to land. A native `cargo
build` on real Windows uses the host MSVC toolchain by default and needs no
`--target` flag, so cargo drops the DLL straight in `target\debug\` — no
triple subdirectory — and Godot correctly reported
`GDExtension dynamic library not found`. Fixed to
`res://../target/debug/cartalith_godot.dll` (and `.../release/...`),
matching a plain `cargo build -p cartalith-godot [--release]` on native
Windows — the path a real contributor actually hits, not the one this
session's sandbox-only cross-compile happened to produce. The `linux.*`
and `android.*` entries were already written this way; only `windows.*`
had the leftover sandbox path.

Once the owner rebuilds with the fixed manifest and re-runs the scene, the
outstanding check is clicking "Ping Rust" and confirming
`cartalith-godot: pong` appears — the actual GDExtension method-call
round-trip, still unconfirmed as of this entry.

## Phase 0 follow-up — owner tried real Android hardware (2026-08-11)

The owner opened the project folder directly in the **Godot Editor Android
app** on a real device (Adreno 750). Useful data even though it failed:

```
OpenGL API OpenGL ES 3.2 ... Compatibility - Using Device: Qualcomm - Adreno (TM) 750
ERROR: Can't open dynamic library: .../target/aarch64-linux-android/debug/libcartalith_godot.so
ERROR: Can't open GDExtension dynamic library: 'res://cartalith.gdextension'.
```

**Godot's own Android runtime works fine on real hardware** — it reached
renderer init before failing on the one thing this session's blocked NDK
never let it build: the `.so` itself doesn't exist yet. This is the exact
gap already logged above (`cargo ndk build` fails with no NDK installed),
not a new problem. Narrows the real remaining Android risk to "does the
gdext cross-compile + on-device load work," not anything about Godot's
Android integration generally.

Also notable: running a project directly from the Godot Editor Android app
is a lighter-weight on-device test than a full `.apk` export/sideload
cycle — worth using once `cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a build -p cartalith-godot`
produces the `.so` on a machine with NDK access. `MVP_SCOPE.md` criterion 4
still wants the actual `.apk` built and sideloaded, so this is a good
interim signal, not a substitute for that.

## Phase 0 close-out — real Windows + Android, on real hardware (2026-08-12)

The owner set up Rust, Godot 4.7.1, and the Android SDK/NDK directly on
their own Windows PC (mirroring `TOOLCHAIN.md`, none of which the cloud
sandbox could reach), then had this session continue there directly —
real tool access to the actual machine, not the copy-paste relay the
earlier entries describe.

**Windows: confirmed.** Rebuilt with the fixed `.gdextension` manifest,
opened a fresh editor session, clicked "Ping Rust" — `cartalith-godot:
pong` appeared. The GDExtension method-call round-trip works, closing the
one gap the previous entry left open.

**Android: confirmed further than before, one more real gap found and
fixed.**

- `cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a build -p cartalith-godot` succeeded. `file` on
  the result confirms `ELF 64-bit ... ARM aarch64 ... built by NDK r29
  (14206865)` — exactly the version Godot 4.7.1 pins
  (`platform/android/detect.py`), not a newer or older one.
- `godot4 --headless --export-debug "Android" builds/android/Cartalith.apk`
  first failed: `ETC2/ASTC texture compression is required for Android
  export`. This is a real, generically-required Godot Android export
  setting that had never been set — nothing about this project's assets
  in particular. Fixed by adding
  `textures/vram_compression/import_etc2_astc=true` to
  `godot-project/project.godot`. Re-running the export then succeeded: a
  real signed debug `.apk` was built and Godot's own verification step
  passed.

**Still open:** `MVP_SCOPE.md` criterion 4 wants the `.apk` **installed
and run** on the device, not just built. This session confirmed the build
and packaging pipeline end-to-end on real hardware — sideloading and
launching it is the next, separate step.

With this, Phase 0's two remaining checkboxes from the original walking
skeleton (`ROADMAP.md`) are both closed on real hardware: Godot loads and
runs the gdext extension, and Windows + Android both build and package.
Phase 1 (`MVP_SCOPE.md`) can start.

## Phase 1 — mulberry32 ported and golden-verified (2026-08-12)

First engine logic in `cartalith-rng`, per `PARITY_TESTING.md`'s explicit
ordering: **port the RNG first, alone, before anything depends on it.**

- Located the reference implementation in `reference/Cartalith Gen1
  v2.10.html` (the `/* ===== noise ===== */` section) and confirmed via
  call-site grep that it's the one MVP scope actually needs — tectonics,
  volcanism, and crater placement all seed from it directly
  (`state.tect.seed`, `state.tect.seed^0x5bf03635`,
  `state.tect.seed^0x27d4eb2f`). The civ-layer `_civRng` elsewhere in the
  file is a different, near-identical implementation used only by
  out-of-MVP-scope code — not ported.
- Extracted golden output by running the **actual JS function under real
  Node.js** (v24.19.0), not hand-derived: 9 seeds (including the two real
  XOR-derived seeds volcanism/craters actually use) × 8 values each = 72
  values, in `cartalith-rng/tests/golden_parity.rs`.
- Ported to `Mulberry32` (`cartalith-rng/src/lib.rs`) on `u32` throughout —
  JS's `Math.imul`/`^`/`>>>` are bit-identical regardless of signed vs.
  unsigned interpretation, so no `i32` split was needed. Division by
  `2^32` is exact in `f64` (power-of-two divisor, integer numerator), so
  the golden test asserts **bit-for-bit equality**, not a tolerance — the
  right bar for pure integer arithmetic, per `PARITY_TESTING.md`'s "give
  each field its own tolerance and record the reasoning."
- `cargo test -p cartalith-rng`: all 72 golden values match exactly.
  `cargo clippy -p cartalith-rng --all-targets`: clean.

**Next**: `hash`, `vnoise`, `fbm`, `ridged` — same section of the reference
file, same golden-extraction method, per `PARITY_TESTING.md`'s stated
order ("port the RNG first, and the noise second").

## Phase 1 — hash/vnoise/fbm/ridged ported, one real sign bug caught (2026-08-12)

`cartalith-noise`, continuing directly from `mulberry32`. Golden data again
extracted by running the actual JS (reference HTML lines 2292-2295) under
Node.js — 234 `hash` cases (13 x-coords x 3 y-coords x 6 seeds, including
negative coordinates) + 108 noise cases (12 float x-coords x 3 y-coords x
3 seeds, each checking `vnoise`/`fbm`/`ridged` together) = 342 values,
generated straight into a Rust test file rather than hand-transcribed
JSON, to rule out transcription error at this volume.

**First golden-test failure of the port, and exactly the kind
`PARITY_TESTING.md` warns about.** `hash`'s middle step
(`h=(h^(h>>>13))*1274126177`) doesn't use `Math.imul` — the product can
reach ~2^61, past `f64`'s exact 53-bit range, so JS's own float64
rounding is genuine, load-bearing behavior here (kept, not "fixed" — see
`cartalith-noise/src/lib.rs`'s doc comment). Getting *that* part right
the first time, the port still initially failed on `hash(0, 7,
668265263)` and others: JS's `^` operator returns a **signed** int32, and
that signed value — not its unsigned bit pattern — is what the following
plain `*` multiplies. The first draft carried the unsigned value forward
instead, silently flipping the sign of the multiplicand (and therefore
the whole result) for roughly half of all outputs. Root-caused by
comparing a step-by-step Node trace against the same steps reasoned
through in Rust, not by loosening the assertion — the discipline the
project's own skill (`cartalith-porting-discipline`) names explicitly:
"a mismatch means re-read the JS... not widen the tolerance."

Fixed with one re-interpretation cast (`h2_bits as i32`) before the
multiply; all 342 values then matched bit-for-bit.

- `cargo test -p cartalith-noise`: all 342 golden values match exactly.
  `cargo clippy -p cartalith-noise --all-targets`: clean.

Also ported `pvnoise`/`pfbm`/`pridged` — the `state.world`-wrap periodic
siblings (x lattice coordinate wraps mod `pX` so noise tiles on a
cylinder) — in the same pass, since they're the same reference-file
section and the same one caveat (JS `%` keeps the dividend's sign; the
`((xi%pX)+pX)%pX` double-mod pattern needs replicating exactly, not
swapped for Rust's `rem_euclid`). All 90 additional golden values matched
on the first attempt — the `hash` sign fix above was the only real trap
in this whole section.

- `cargo test -p cartalith-noise`: all 432 golden values (342 + 90) match
  exactly. `cargo clippy -p cartalith-noise --all-targets`: clean.

**Next**: `buildTectonicSubstrate()` — the first real pipeline stage
(`MVP_SCOPE.md` point 1), and the first one built on top of `mulberry32`
+ this noise module rather than tested in isolation.
